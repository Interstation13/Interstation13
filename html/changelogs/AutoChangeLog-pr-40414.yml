changes: 
  - bugfix: "Resolved a large number of instances where items would not work as their respective tool types (ie plasma cutters not working as welders.)"
  - bugfix: "Using an item that acts as a multitool that does not have a buffer on an object that requires a buffer will now consistently provide user feedback for why it failed."
